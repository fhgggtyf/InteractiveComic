## Project Name: The Campus Light, an Interactive Comic

This project is a web-based interactive comic story about a university girl called Emily discovering the campus guardian monster at night.

**Concept and storyline**: The overall concept of the story is depicting the discovery journey of a girl called Emily at NYUAD finding out a monster on campus who protects the Torch, the symbol of NYUAD, that emits light at night. In the beginning, Emily is wandering around the campus and decides to enter the Campus Center to go back to her dorm room. However, when she gets into the building, she finds a magical door shining brightly in the dark that she never sees before. The magical door immediately draws her attention and makes her walk toward it. When she opens the door, she sees a long, dark, and thrilling corridor with some light at the end. As she walks toward the light, a monster suddenly appears behind her. Feeling something weird and gazing back, Emily sees nothing; now the monster hides somewhere. Finally, Emily reaches the end of the corridor and sees the Torch lighting there. Now, the monster reveals itself and to Emily's surprise, it is small, cute, and shy! Such as an adorable guardian of the campus light!

The experience this project tries to create is the one that makes the user get into the story of Emily and feel how Emily feels when the story goes on. From scared to surprised and then to adored, we hope that the readers could feel emotionally connected to Emily's experience and find a bit of fun at the end of the story.



**Process**: The process of brainstorming, visualizing, and implementation was challenging. We were trying to figure out the story we wanted to tell our views. We decided to create an NYUAD monster story that has a twist. We wanted it to be relatable; we placed it on campus. Then, we decided to figure out the characters of the story. We tried to generate IA figures to get inspired, but we ended up creating the characters ourselves with some inspiration from AI generators. Then, we began designing the panels we wanted. We decided not to add all the different vectors into one PNG but rather to add them into the HTML and move them using Javascript. In total, we had seven panels; each panel was a crucial part of the story. Figuring out how to align everything in the HTML file was a big challenge, and it took us some time to figure out. We met many times after class and during weekends to work together on the project and help one another understand and figure things out. 

**General Design**: The implementation of this website includes the applications of various techniques learnt in class including Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML, CSS and Javascrip. We started by deciding on the story type and the plot. Then, we used AI-generated images to find inspirations for the characters. With these geenrated images and some oneline images, we used Ai and Ps to process images to make them more comic-like.

**Interactivity**: The interactivity of this website aims at showing the motions of the characters and making the story more interesting. The most prominant interaction is the walking motion of Emily; it indicates the progress of the story as Emily walks.

**Comic Sensibility**: Our comin mainly focuses on the sequance of the pannels to empower the overall narritive of the story line. We used realisitc figure for the backgrounds and iconic ones for the characters and it gave a nive contrats to the diffrent pannels. 

**Work Distribution**:
Shahd: I helped write the story and create the character's illustrations and some panels. I wrote some captions for the story and some dialogue. I also helped in the coding process and styling of the website and the README file.

Yupu: I helped write the story and in creating the panels mainly the backgrounds, the design for the captions, and the dialogue. I also helped with the code, the website, and the ReadMe file.

Jason Xia: My main role was to work on the pannels' animation mainly the movement of Emily and the ghost throughout the story. I also helped in designing the website's overall look and functionality. 

Peirre: I helped write the story, and created some panels, and helped in the code. 

We all helped in brainstorming the story and the implementation process. 


**Reflection and Evaluation**: 
We are satisfired with the overall result of the website. We think if we had more time we could add sound and some more interactivity to it. It was a challange to get all of what we had in mind done but we maneged.
