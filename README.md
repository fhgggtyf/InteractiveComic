## Project Name: The Campus Light, an Interactive Comic

This project is a web-based interactive comic story about a university girl called Emily discovering the campus guardian monster at night.

**Concept and storyline**: The overall concept of the story is depicting the discovery journey of a girl called Emily at NYUAD finding out a monster on campus who protects the Torch, the symbol of NYUAD, that emits light at night. In the beginning, Emily is wandering around the campus and decides to enter the Campus Center to go back to her dorm room. However, when she gets into the building, she finds a magical door shining brightly in the dark that she never sees before. The magical door immediately draws her attention and makes her walk toward it. When she opens the door, she sees a long, dark, and thrilling corridor with some light at the end. As she walks toward the light, a monster suddenly appears behind her. Feeling something weird and gazing back, Emily sees nothing; now the monster hides somewhere. Finally, Emily reaches the end of the corridor and sees the Torch lighting there. Now, the monster reveals itself and to Emily's surprise, it is small, cute, and shy! Such as an adorable guardian of the campus light!

The experience this project tries to create is the one that makes the user get into the story of Emily and feel how Emily feels when the story goes on. From scared to surprised and then to adored, we hope that the readers could feel emotionally connected to Emily's experience and find a bit of fun at the end of the story.
